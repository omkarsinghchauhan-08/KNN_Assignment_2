    "# Ques 1\n",
    "# Ans -- The main difference between the Euclidean distance metric and the Manhattan distance metric lies in how they calculate distances between points in a feature space:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Euclidean Distance**:\n",
    "   - Also known as L2 norm, it calculates the straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space.\n",
    "   - In a 2D plane, the Euclidean distance between points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is calculated using the formula:\n",
    "     \\[d_{\\text{euclidean}} = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\]\n",
    "   - In n-dimensional space, the Euclidean distance is calculated as:\n",
    "     \\[d_{\\text{euclidean}} = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{2i} - x_{1i})^2}\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Manhattan Distance**:\n",
    "   - Also known as L1 norm or City Block distance, it calculates the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding coordinates of the points.\n",
    "   - In a 2D plane, the Manhattan distance between points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is calculated using the formula:\n",
    "     \\[d_{\\text{manhattan}} = |x_2 - x_1| + |y_2 - y_1|\\]\n",
    "   - In n-dimensional space, the Manhattan distance is calculated as:\n",
    "     \\[d_{\\text{manhattan}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_{2i} - x_{1i}|\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Effect on KNN Performance**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sensitivity to Feature Scales**:\n",
    "   - Euclidean distance considers the magnitude of differences in all dimensions equally, while Manhattan distance is less sensitive to differences in individual dimensions. This means that Euclidean distance may be more affected by features with different scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sensitivity to Dimensionality**:\n",
    "   - Euclidean distance becomes increasingly sensitive to dimensionality as the number of features increases. This is due to the \"curse of dimensionality,\" which can lead to sparse data and less meaningful distances. Manhattan distance is generally more robust in high-dimensional spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Impact on Decision Boundaries**:\n",
    "   - The choice of distance metric can affect the shape of decision boundaries. Euclidean distance may lead to circular or spherical decision boundaries, while Manhattan distance may result in hyper-rectangular boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Outliers and Noisy Data**:\n",
    "   - Manhattan distance can be more robust to outliers and noisy data, as it considers the absolute differences rather than squared differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Complexity of Computation**:\n",
    "   - Calculating Euclidean distance involves square roots and exponentiation, which can be computationally more expensive than the absolute value operations involved in Manhattan distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the choice between Euclidean and Manhattan distance should be based on the specific characteristics of the data and problem. Experimentation and validation using both metrics can help determine which one is more suitable for a given scenario. Additionally, other distance metrics can be considered based on the nature of the data and problem."

    "\n",
    "**Common Hyperparameters in KNN**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **'k' (Number of Neighbors)**:\n",
    "   - **Effect**: Determines the number of nearest neighbors to consider when making predictions. Smaller 'k' values can lead to more complex models that are sensitive to noise, while larger 'k' values can lead to smoother decision boundaries but may overlook local patterns.\n",
